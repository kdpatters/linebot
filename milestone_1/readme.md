# Milestone 1
## Getting the robot to move
For this milestone, I imported the code for the Zumo shield from Arduino's curated libraries into the Arduino IDE.  Then, I used the ZumoMotors class from the [ZumoShield library](https://pololu.github.io/zumo-shield-arduino-library/classZumoMotors.html) to set the speed of the motors to drive the robot forward for a fixed period of time.  To improve modularity of the code, I created separate functions to drive the robot forward, stop the robot from moving, turn right, and turn left all at a fixed speed.  A future improvement would be to quantify the amount of distance I expect the robot to travel.

Milestone 1: Create your own code that moves the Zumo at least 4 feet.
